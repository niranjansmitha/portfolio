        I am a Mechanical Engineering undergraduate at IIT Bombay with a strong interest in algorithmic trading, quantitative finance, and applied machine learning. My work focuses on building and evaluating systematic trading strategies, implementing financial models, and developing efficient algorithms for real-time data analysis.

I enjoy working on problems that require mathematical rigor, careful modeling, and performance evaluation, and I am motivated by roles that emphasize analytical depth and disciplined problem-solving.
